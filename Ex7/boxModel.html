    College life at VIT has been an exciting journey filled with opportunities for learning and growth.
    As a second-year computer science student, I've been able to dive deeper into coding, algorithms, 
    and software development, which I find both challenging and rewarding. Outside of academics, 
    Iâ€™ve enjoyed participating in various tech events, hackathons, and making new friends who share 
    similar interests.
